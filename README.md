  🐣 Frameless boilerplate
</h1>

## A simple boilerplate to start coding web apps without using frameworks

<div style="color:#333333">

### 😶 Why bother creating this?

The idea of this boilerplate is to create a starting point to start developing websites without worrying about bundlers, bundlers, compilers and etc... Everything is ready out of the box, just needing it to install stuff through a package manager


### 🖥 How do these stuff work?

Everything is pre-configured in the webpack files to provide an environment for development and also to build the application for production. There are already some useful webpack plugins that are used to optimize the build process.
There are also configurations for eslint and also editor config.

### 🚜 What is under the hood?

- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Editor config](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### 🎛 So... How to set up the environment?

Install dependencies and then run `start` to develop locally or run `build` to create a build for production

```bash
# Installing dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn

# Running locally
npm start
# or
yarn start

# Build for production
npm run build
# or
yarn run build
```

### 📝 Notes

- This is a work in progress, which means this boilerplate can change in the future
- This README file is also part of the boilerplate, which means it provides a structure that can be used to explain the project. Simple overwrite what is written here.
